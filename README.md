### What is this?

This is a little KOA microservice template I put together to get me easily started with a nodejs project and only focus on what matters. Wiring code gets old really fast if you do this all the time

### How do i use it?
Dont! It's not for you.

### Please
Okay clone it then.

### What components are included?
- Logging (Not completed, will use pino)
- ESlint StandardJS (Because semicolons suck)
- Koa Helmet (Powered By, HSTS)
