### What is this?

This is a little KOA microservice template I put together to get me easily started with a nodejs project and only focus on what matters.

### How do i use it?
- clone it
- npm install
- npm start

### What components are included?
- Logging (Not completed, will use pino)
- ESlint StandardJS (Because semicolons suck)
- Koa Helmet (Powered By, HSTS)
- Docker
